Introduction: This is Mini Project 8 ("Bit trees and Braille"), written by Madel Sibal.

Description: The following submission contains a program that helps the user learn braille through the use of binary trees.

Resources: Oracle Help Center was used in order to figure out basic Java syntax and techniques. In addition, the readings/labs on trees, tree traversal, and binary search trees were an essential part of this project. Lastly, Professor Sam helped by clarifying the instructions of the projects during class and through his website. I consulted with Jonathan Wang, Jinny Eo, and Maria Rodriguez to discuss the implementation of certain procedures in this project.
